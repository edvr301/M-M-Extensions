# M-M-Extensions
This website was built for a company called M&M Extensions. My team consisted of three people (myself, Justin and Aleksander) and we built it using HTML and CSS and a bit of Javascript. We first interviewed the client and found out what he needed and the problems he faced. We researched and then created some wireframes for the website. We then created low and high fidelity prototypes which we would follow while we coded the website. We all took different pages and sections that we would code. We also had to outsource work because we didn't know how to get the quote calculator working on the website.

You can navigate through the different pages and explore the website.
