</button>
    <div class="details">
      <p>
        1 SIPs save money in every phase of their lifecycle – building with SIPs benefits homeowners with an overall 35% savings compared to conventional building methods thanks to the following features:<br><br>
●        Automated production delivers precision, saving time and resources<br><br>
●        Reduced man-hours in assembly and installation<br><br>
●        Heavily reduced energy consumption throughout their entire life<br><br>
●        High-quality and strength of the panels result in an extended product life<br><br>
●        Eliminate the need to vacate the property and spend money on accommodation during construction<br><br>

2 Engineered and constructed to suit any building, we can create SIPs that completely align to your architectural and design vision – gaining all the mentioned benefits without compromising on appearance to create a space that’s uniquely yours.<br><br>

3 SIPs are unparalleled in their insulation and airtightness – halving the energy consumptions of traditional timber frames. Buildings that utilise the incredible feats of SIPs are LEED aligned and net-zero-ready structures, so you’ll be contributing to a sustainable future while being less affected by outside weather conditions.<br><br>

4 SIPs are among the most sustainable and eco-friendly building systems available, remaining so for the rest of their lives. Not only do they heavily reduce energy consumption in the home and reduce CO2 levels in the environment, but their materials use less energy in production, and their factory construction method wastes fewer resources than on-site construction.

    <button class="accordion">How long does my new extension/building last?</button>
    <div class="details">
      <p>The extension can easily withstand almost all weather conditions and remain in great condition for over 100 years if well cared for. Extension walls need to have new sealers added to the wood after 40 years to ensure the extension remains in good condition.

SIP Energy U-Values
U-values are one component in your building Energy Rating (BER). Final u-values on SIP Energy buildings depend on a combination of panel thickness and type of internal lining (plasterboard) chosen. Coupled with your floor insulation and window/door choices, SIP construction is the easiest way to achieve high BER scores.
A summary of panel values are shown as follows:
<br>
<br>

Internal Lining / Panel Thickness	  130mm	155mm	180mm <br>
Standard 12.5mm Plaster Board	      0.26		0.23		0.16<br>
37mm Insulated Plaster Board	  	  0.21		0.18		0.15<br>
50mm Insulated Plaster Board		    0.18		0.16		0.14<br>
62mm Insulated Plaster Board 	      0.16		0.14		0.13<br>

<br>
<br>
 
Remember: it is possible to achieve very high energy ratings (A, B), even with modest panel u-values, due to the inherent airtightness.
SIP Energy & Airtightness Performance – the Industry leader
Airtightness of a building has been estimated to account for between 20% – 30% of your building’s energy requirement.
By virtue of building with SIP Energy panels, you are already on the path to not only exceed Airtightness requirements, as laid down in Building Regulations, but also to exceed Passive standards.

    <button class="accordion">Available guarantees? </button>
    <div class="details">
      <p>There is a 10 year guarantee which applies to the roof work on the extension.

  <div class="accordion-wrapper">
    <button class="accordion">What is the acoustic dampening like? </button>
    <div class="details">
      <p>The sound resistance of a SIP wall depends on the thickness of the gypsum drywall applied, the exterior finish applied and the thickness of the insulating foam core that is used. SIPs are especially effective at blocking high frequency noise, and most homeowners notice the quiet comfort of a SIP home. However, low frequency sounds are not as effectively stopped by a SIP building envelope.
For multifamily and commercial buildings, a universal sound transmission coefficient (STC) is used to specify the sound resistance of wall assemblies. Assemblies with a range of STC ratings are available, including options with a STC rating greater than 50 for party walls in multifamily buildings. SIP manufacturers can provide more information on these assemblies.

  <div class="accordion-wrapper">
    <button class="accordion">What are SIPs?</button>
    <div class="details">
      <p>Structural insulated panels (SIPs) are high-performance building panels used in floors, walls, and roofs for residential and light commercial buildings. The panels are made by sandwiching a core of rigid foam plastic insulation between two structural facings, such as oriented strand board (OSB). Other skin materials can be used for specific purposes. SIPs are manufactured under factory controlled conditions and can be custom designed for each project. The result is a building system that is extremely strong, energy-efficient and cost effective. Building with SIPs will save you time, money and labor.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="accordion-wrapper">
    <button class="accordion">How Sustainable are SIPs?</button>
    <div class="details">
      <p>Structural insulated panels are one of the most environmentally responsible building systems available. A SIP building envelope provides continuous insulation, is extremely airtight, allows for better control over indoor air quality, reduces construction waste, and helps save natural resources. Life cycle analysis has shown that SIP homes have a tremendous positive environmental impact by reducing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions throughout the home’s life cycle. SIP designs can save 45% more CO2 with a 5.1 year energy payback and a 3.8 year greenhouse gas payback compared to stick framing examples. 
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

<div class="accordion-wrapper">
    <button class="accordion">How strong are SIPs?</button>
    <div class="details">
      <p>The structural characteristics of SIPs are similar to that of a steel I-beam. The OSB facers act as the flange of the I-beam, while the rigid foam core provides the web. This design gives SIPs an advantage when handling in-plane compressive loads. SIPs are used for high wind designs in excess of 280 kmh. The load-bearing area of SIPs is equivalent to building with 2 x 10 framing at 40 Centimeters on center.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="accordion-wrapper">
    <button class="accordion">How do SIPs react to fire?
</button>
    <div class="details">
      <p>Like all wood frame buildings, SIPs present a manageable fire risk when their construction meets the fire precautions listed in the building code. Residential codes typically require the application of a 30-minute fire-resistant thermal barrier on the interior for all residential structures, accomplished by applying 1/2-in. thick gypsum board or a material of equivalent thermal performance.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="accordion-wrapper">
    <button class="accordion">Are SIPs compatible with other building systems?</button>
    <div class="details">
      <p>SIPs are compatible with almost any building system. Wall panels can sit on a variety of foundation materials, including poured concrete, blocks, or insulated concrete forms. SIPs are sized to accept dimensional lumber and are seamlessly compatible with stick framing. Builders may choose to build with SIP walls and a conventional truss roof or with stick walls and a SIP roof with little difficulty. SIPs are also popular as a method of providing a well-insulated building enclosure for timber frame and steel structures.

   <div class="accordion-wrapper">
    <button class="accordion">How are electrical wirings and fixtures installed?</button>
    <div class="details">
      <p>Electrical wires are pulled through pre-cut channels inside the core of the panels called “chases.” Chases are added during the manufacturing process according to the electrical design of the home. Electricians can feed wires through panel chases without compressing the insulation or drilling through studs.
